> Properly secured sessions guaranteed by SSL certificates are a critical component of the modern web site. Many developers haven't had enough exposure to managing them because they've historically cost more than you'd want to spend on a toy project. Enter [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), "Let’s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open certificate authority, run for the public’s benefit."

> In this session you'll see how you can quickly easily deploy your own free SSL certificate using the [Caddy HTTP server](https://caddyserver.com/). We'll be securing a simple web app — a dice-rolling microservice written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). If you've been curious about Let's Encrypt, Go or microservices, come on by!
